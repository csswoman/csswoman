## <img src="./assets/waving-hand.webp" width="4%"> Hey there! I’m Karla — UX Engineer & Frontend Developer

A web developer who transforms ideas into interactive, accessible, and scalable experiences.

💻 I started my journey into web development in 2020 and haven’t stopped learning since. I’m passionate about the intersection of design and code, where creativity meets structure.

🎨 I craft pixel-perfect, responsive, and inclusive interfaces that feel as good as they look — bringing design systems to life with React, TailwindCSS, and a strong eye for detail.

🧠 I love solving complex UI puzzles and turning wireframes into dynamic, maintainable components. My approach blends clean architecture, micro-interactions, and meaningful motion.

🎮 Video games inspire me — not just for fun, but for their storytelling, interfaces, and emotional design. They remind me that good UX tells a story.

🤝 Collaboration fuels me. I believe in sharing knowledge, helping others grow, and contributing to projects that make the web more beautiful and accessible for everyone.
